# BetterGameplay

A simple mod that adds various QOL improvements.  

#### THIS MOD IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND MAY HAVE BUGS

I highly recommend that when using this mod ( or any mod ) you understand that bugs can happen.


## Currently implemented:
- Items that fall off the map are teleported up
- Your equipment is paused in the Baazar if you have a Gesture of the Drowned
